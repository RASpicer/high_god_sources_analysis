The fact that certain elements of the ritual-religious system the Europeans encountered in Hawaii had probably been in place for a few centuries at first seemed sufficient to infer the presence of other elements, such as this one.

[373] ""The fifth article of Islamic faith is belief in life after death. The life of this world and all that is in it will come to an end on a divinely appointed date, which is called the Last Day (Qiyamat).

The entire record of every person will be presented before God for final judgement (Hisab). Those who excel in goodness will be rewarded. Those whose evils and wrongdoings outweigh their good deeds will be punished. Those who are condemned and deserve punishment will be sent to hell (Jahannam). Those who emerge successfully from the final judgement will go to paradise (Cannat). [...]Muslims must desist from the practice of infanticide, from adultery, from killing unjustly, from robbing orphans, from cheating in trade, from believing false reports and from showing pride: ‘Do not slay your offspring for fear of want. It is We who provide for them, and for you. Indeed their killing is a great sin. Do not approach adultery, for it is an indecent thing and an evil way. Do not take the life which Allah has rendered sacrosanct, except for a just cause.... Do not approach the property of an orphan except in the way that is best (responsible investment) until he attains majority. Keep your covenants, for one is responsible for one's covenant.

The Truk people also say about disagreeable events: tinien Önulap, that is, decree of the “Great Spirit.” When an önu punishes a human being, the natives express this in the phrase önu a ku, the spirit has bitten. This “bite” manifests itself in various ways: by the swelling of limbs, stiff neck, maimings, epilepsy, sudden death, etc. The “bites” are regularly directed [Page 29] against a person’s life, which accounts for the fact that the natives are concerned about manau, life, more than anything else.

The entire record of every person will be presented before God for final judgement (Hisab). Those who excel in goodness will be rewarded. Those whose evils and wrongdoings outweigh their good deeds will be punished. Those who are condemned and deserve punishment will be sent to hell (Jahannam).

However, they did not punish or reward mortals on the basis of morality. 'The Garo believe in supernatural beings whom they call mite. This word may be glossed both as “gods” and as “spirits”. As Robbins Burling (1963:54), who studied the Garo in India, writes, the term mite “covers both beings whom we would call gods and certain lesser, quite different nuisances, which hardly deserve to be known by any term more dignified than spirits.” To some of these mite the Garo attribute the creation of all the creatures of the world, the control of natural phenomena and the granting of health, wealth and happiness to mankind. Other mite, they say, are the cause of illness, disease and other misfortune. Consequently, Garo talk of some mite as being good and friendly, because they can help mankind, and others as being invariably malicious. But, Garo say, friendly mite are also capable of causing sickness and misfortune, if people anger them. But whether beneficent or malicious, Garo do not terminologically differentiate the two kinds of mite. Furthermore they say that all mite, good or bad, need to be propitiated.' [1,062] 'No suggestion is made that a man’s behavior in this world affects his later destiny. Spirits and gods are amoral, and punishment for wrong behavior comes in this world or not at all. One treats the spirits and gods with respect and circumspection because they can cause sickness and crop failure, but they do not send these as punishment for immoral behavior. Morality has a more pragmatic basis. Nothing is wrong unless it hurts someone else, and one may expect that the other person and his family will take action against the wrongdoer. One need not wait for punishment from the gods.'[1,063]","1"

"Kachi Plain","PkIndGr",-145,-96,"moralizing","3",1,"The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple.” [327] ""It is now evident that, for Hesiod, κακότης‎ represents moral badness and the opposite to virtue, arete. A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community. Just as Hesiod connects the bad man with injustice and religious danger, so he presents moral righteousness and adherence to justice (δίκη‎) as coexisting with ritual correctness. Gregory Nagy points out that in Op. 336–41, a passage which follows the lines quoted above, the moral correctness of δίκη‎ is ‘programmatically re-enforced by the ritual correctness of the just man’:26 Perses is again reminded that gods punish unjust deeds (ἄδικα ἔργα‎; vv. 325–34), and that he should often sacrifice purely and cleanly to the deathless gods and propitiate them often with libations and incense (vv. 336–41). Religious correctness is thus laid out as avoiding unjust deeds and as honouring the gods with sacrifices and libations.//""In vv. 325–34 the following deeds are listed as unjust (ἄδικα ἔργα‎): gaining wealth by force, stealing, or deception; wronging a suppliant or a guest; engaging in illicit sexual intercourse; offending orphans or aged parents. These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333–4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in agos. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus. It governs all social and religious relationships; it encompasses religious correctness. Moral goodness equals adherence to justice, whereas ‘badness’ (κακία‎ or κακότης‎) is equal to injustice and religious transgression.""","4"

"Lena River Valley","RuYakuE",1400,1642,"active","2",0,"Yakut spirits and deities appear qualify as high gods, in that they have created and rule over reality. 'Originally, Tangara-the sky god, the father of the gods, typologically comparable to the Rigvedic D’iaus, and to the Latin concept of “god” (D’iaus-Deos-Theo)-was supposed to occupy the dominant position among the aiyy deities. Later, this image was embodied in the central figure of the Yakut pantheon, Iuriung Aiyy toion, the “White Creator God,” the god of light, the personified image of the Sun, with the functions of sovereign of the Universe. Then came the other aiyy deities. A particularly important place was occupied by Aal Uot ichchite, the spirit of sacred fire-both of the sacrificial flame and of the domestic hearth. Like the Arian Agni, Aal Uot ichchite was considered to be the protector of the family and the giver of good fortune and healthy offspring. If the goddess Ieiiekhsit was regarded as the messenger of Iuriung Aiyy toion, then the spirit of fire fulfilled the function of intermediary between earth and heaven, between humanity and the gods.' [817] However, it appears they were not moralizing. 'Very characteristic of the Yakut beliefs is the absence of conceptions of paradise and hell and the lack of any idea of retaliation as we understand it. The Yakut word aj[unknown]y usually translated, sin, means more properly, harm, damage; for instance, aj[unknown]y is used when milk is spoiled by a mouse falling into it, or, when a man’s bed is contaminated by a frog.'[818] 'The Yakut love life and hold the present in very high esteem, but the future, particularly that which will come after death, does not concern them particularly. Any conception of the aims of existence and of the future fate of all living things, of the end of the world, or of what will happen to a man after his death is relatively weakly developed among them. Those few ideas on the subject which they borrowed from the Russians together with Christianity have somehow dried up in their minds, become dim, and have been delegated to the background. If we except the pale and corrupted Biblical paraphrases of the end of the world, paradise, and hell, they have hardly any beliefs on the bond between life on earth and life after death in the sense of punishment or reward.'[819] 'The Yakut Satan, that allara abasy ogonior (the old man-spirit of the underworld) who is sometimes also called Satan, is a quite different conception, although recently he took has begun to take on some of the attributes of his Biblical equivalent. For example, he is called the king of the evil spirits, abasy yrakhta, although he is by no means considered to be the most powerful among the fetishes and spirits embodying the evil and harmful forces of nature. It is noteworthy that the Yakut world conception does not bear any mystical facets; they are aware of harmful, helpful, and indifferent phenomena, but no sinful phenomena. The concept of grace, as a result of the victory by the spirit over the body, mortification of the flesh, chastity, humility, and other ascetic ideals, is completely foreign to them. They have the word aji - sin, but the meaning of this word is quite different.

"Lena River Valley","RuYakuL",NA,NA,"active","2",0,"Yakut spirits and deities appear qualify as high gods, in that they have created and rule over reality. 'Originally, Tangara-the sky god, the father of the gods, typologically comparable to the Rigvedic D’iaus, and to the Latin concept of “god” (D’iaus-Deos-Theo)-was supposed to occupy the dominant position among the aiyy deities. Later, this image was embodied in the central figure of the Yakut pantheon, Iuriung Aiyy toion, the “White Creator God,” the god of light, the personified image of the Sun, with the functions of sovereign of the Universe. Then came the other aiyy deities. A particularly important place was occupied by Aal Uot ichchite, the spirit of sacred fire-both of the sacrificial flame and of the domestic hearth. Like the Arian Agni, Aal Uot ichchite was considered to be the protector of the family and the giver of good fortune and healthy offspring. If the goddess Ieiiekhsit was regarded as the messenger of Iuriung Aiyy toion, then the spirit of fire fulfilled the function of intermediary between earth and heaven, between humanity and the gods.' [933] However, it appears they were not moralizing. 'Very characteristic of the Yakut beliefs is the absence of conceptions of paradise and hell and the lack of any idea of retaliation as we understand it. The Yakut word aj[unknown]y usually translated, sin, means more properly, harm, damage; for instance, aj[unknown]y is used when milk is spoiled by a mouse falling into it, or, when a man’s bed is contaminated by a frog.'[934] 'The Yakut love life and hold the present in very high esteem, but the future, particularly that which will come after death, does not concern them particularly. Any conception of the aims of existence and of the future fate of all living things, of the end of the world, or of what will happen to a man after his death is relatively weakly developed among them. Those few ideas on the subject which they borrowed from the Russians together with Christianity have somehow dried up in their minds, become dim, and have been delegated to the background. If we except the pale and corrupted Biblical paraphrases of the end of the world, paradise, and hell, they have hardly any beliefs on the bond between life on earth and life after death in the sense of punishment or reward.'[935] 'The Yakut Satan, that allara abasy ogonior (the old man-spirit of the underworld) who is sometimes also called Satan, is a quite different conception, although recently he took has begun to take on some of the attributes of his Biblical equivalent. For example, he is called the king of the evil spirits, abasy yrakhta, although he is by no means considered to be the most powerful among the fetishes and spirits embodying the evil and harmful forces of nature. It is noteworthy that the Yakut world conception does not bear any mystical facets; they are aware of harmful, helpful, and indifferent phenomena, but no sinful phenomena. The concept of grace, as a result of the victory by the spirit over the body, mortification of the flesh, chastity, humility, and other ascetic ideals, is completely foreign to them. They have the word aji - sin, but the meaning of this word is quite different. I myself have not been able to establish completely just what concepts this word includes, but most probably it is the idea of suffering. In the past they said arakh; this is the same as aji. (Namsk Ulus, 1889). The concepts of faith as virtue and doubt as sin are both equally incomprehensible to them.'[936] 'I shall close this brief sketch of Yakut beliefs with a description of a cult which differs from all the gloomy beliefs I have heretofore described by its light and joyous character.

"Sogdiana","IrSeleu",-300,-249,"moralizing","3",1,"""The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple.” [587] ""It is now evident that, for Hesiod, κακότης‎ represents moral badness and the opposite to virtue, arete. A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community.

These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333–4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in agos. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus.

That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple.” [486] ""It is now evident that, for Hesiod, κακότης‎ represents moral badness and the opposite to virtue, arete. A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community.

"Susiana","IrSeleu",-312,-144,"moralizing","3",1,"""The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple.” [587] ""It is now evident that, for Hesiod, κακότης‎ represents moral badness and the opposite to virtue, arete. A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community. Just as Hesiod connects the bad man with injustice and religious danger, so he presents moral righteousness and adherence to justice (δίκη‎) as coexisting with ritual correctness. Gregory Nagy points out that in Op. 336–41, a passage which follows the lines quoted above, the moral correctness of δίκη‎ is ‘programmatically re-enforced by the ritual correctness of the just man’:26 Perses is again reminded that gods punish unjust deeds (ἄδικα ἔργα‎; vv. 325–34), and that he should often sacrifice purely and cleanly to the deathless gods and propitiate them often with libations and incense (vv. 336–41). Religious correctness is thus laid out as avoiding unjust deeds and as honouring the gods with sacrifices and libations.//""In vv. 325–34 the following deeds are listed as unjust (ἄδικα ἔργα‎): gaining wealth by force, stealing, or deception; wronging a suppliant or a guest; engaging in illicit sexual intercourse; offending orphans or aged parents. These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333–4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in agos. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus. It governs all social and religious relationships; it encompasses religious correctness. Moral goodness equals adherence to justice, whereas ‘badness’ (κακία‎ or κακότης‎) is equal to injustice and religious transgression.""","3"
