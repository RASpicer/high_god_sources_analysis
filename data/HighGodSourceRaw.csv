Big Island Hawaii,Hawaii3,1,"A creator god existed, and his name was Kane. However, it is not clear that he also enforced moral behaviour among humans. But, based on the fact that people prayed to him in temples, asking him to grant them things like wisdom and prosperity, perhaps it is reasonable to code him as ""active"". Admittedly, however, things are somewhat complicated by the fact that Kane was also assisted by the gods Ku and Lono during creation (though he himself played the dominant role), and that, when people prayed to Kane, they often prayed ""through"" lesser gods, e.g. family gods ('aumakua). Based on information provided by Beckwith[840], though we also made sure that our codings do not diverge from the supplementary materials in Watts et al. (2015)[841] NB This descriptive text refers to the period following European contact. The fact that certain elements of the ritual-religious system the Europeans encountered in Hawaii had probably been in place for a few centuries at first seemed sufficient to infer the presence of other elements, such as this one. However, this approach now seems too speculative."

Central Java,IdMatrm,2,"Allah created and governs the cosmos. At the resurrection (Hashr), Allah will send individuals to hell (Jahannam) or paradise (Cannat) after final judgment (Hisab) of their behavior (e.g. cheating, theft). ""As an uncompromising and pure monotheistic religion, according to Islam, God is one and unique (tawhid); and He has no partner, no children and no parents. He is eternal and everywhere. He is Creator of the universe, which is not self-explanatory. He is merciful, compassionate and loving. He sent prophets to guide humankind, to tell us how to live like good individuals and be happy in this world and the hereafter."" [373] ""The fifth article of Islamic faith is belief in life after death. The life of this world and all that is in it will come to an end on a divinely appointed date, which is called the Last Day (Qiyamat). All human beings who have lived in the world will then be restored to life and will be presented before God. This is called resurrection (Hashr). The entire record of every person will be presented before God for final judgement (Hisab). Those who excel in goodness will be rewarded. Those whose evils and wrongdoings outweigh their good deeds will be punished. Those who are condemned and deserve punishment will be sent to hell (Jahannam). Those who emerge successfully from the final judgement will go to paradise (Cannat). [...]Muslims must desist from the practice of infanticide, from adultery, from killing unjustly, from robbing orphans, from cheating in trade, from believing false reports and from showing pride: ‘Do not slay your offspring for fear of want. It is We who provide for them, and for you. Indeed their killing is a great sin. Do not approach adultery, for it is an indecent thing and an evil way. Do not take the life which Allah has rendered sacrosanct, except for a just cause.... Do not approach the property of an orphan except in the way that is best (responsible investment) until he attains majority. Keep your covenants, for one is responsible for one's covenant. Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with even scales (when you weigh). This is better, and will be the best in the end. Do not go after that of which you have no knowledge, for (man's) eyes, ears and heart, each of these (senses) shall be closely questioned. Do not walk proudly on the earth (Qur'an, 17:31-7).'""

Chuuk Islands,FmTrukE,1,"There is clearly a High God, Önulap. 'Önulap is the highest of the gods. He is the father of the gods and human beings. Everything comes from him, including illness and misfortune. Everything is tinien Önulap (fate, messenger of the great spirit). Human beings too belong to Önulap. The Truk people believe that Whites are the first-born, the Blacks, the Kanakas, the younger children of the great spirit. They express this in the following phrase: “ Naun Önulap muänidi re uon, naun /7/ sodubudur kanaka.” Önulap also knows everything that human beings do, since a turn of speech runs: “ Si a fadal le mesen Önulap” (we walk in the presence of the great spirit). The gods and spirits are also subject to Önulap. Whatever they do they do only at his command. Since Önulap stands so high and also does not come down to the uanönu like most of the other gods, his individual worship is rarer. In important matters, for example, in case of war, he is invoked.'[698] It's not very clear whether Önulap himself punished or rewarded mortals, but it is clear that the gods in general actively intervened in human affairs--though possibly not on the basis of moral principles. 'The natives express the relationship of the önu to the human being and vice versa in the following parallelism: Emen a önubodede, a feiot; emen a önumamau a [unknown]au, “when one is obedient to the önu, then he is happy; but when he is rebellious toward the önu, then he is unhappy.” In other words: For one who obeys the spirits, it will go well; for one who disobeys them, it will go badly. Having everything go well is brought about by the protection of the önu; things go badly because of their inflicting punishment on human beings. Thus, everything adverse in the world is punishment for the violation of the commands or prohibitions which the önu, and especially Önulap, have imposed on h human beings. The Truk people also say about disagreeable events: tinien Önulap, that is, decree of the “Great Spirit.” When an önu punishes a human being, the natives express this in the phrase önu a ku, the spirit has bitten. This “bite” manifests itself in various ways: by the swelling of limbs, stiff neck, maimings, epilepsy, sudden death, etc. The “bites” are regularly directed [Page 29] against a person’s life, which accounts for the fact that the natives are concerned about manau, life, more than anything else. But by life they almost exclusively mean manauen inisit, life of the body, inasmuch as, despite their knowledge of the other world, they have no desire whatsoever to go to the other world.'"

Cuzco,PeInca*,1,"""I don't think the Incas would imbue Inti with omnipotence, and certainly not omniscience. Supernatural entities in the Andes had great powers, but the most powerful simply had the greatest power to act in their particular domain. For example, stories of the great mountain Pariaqaqa claim that it held the potential to end the universe, but it could not create a new one, nor could it act as a patron for military conquest. The creator Viracocha could make a new universe, but not necessarily provide the warmth, water, and fertility needed to sustain life.""[585]At the major pilgrimage site at Lake Titicaca, ""Inca priests waited for the pilgrims to 'confess,' interrogating them about the faults that they and their communities may have committed in the observance of the Inca state religion and other obligations. Hiding any failures was considered a grave sin, leading to the most terrible punishments for them and their people by the all-powerful and omniscient Sun god.""

He is Creator of the universe, which is not self-explanatory. He is merciful, compassionate and loving. He sent prophets to guide humankind, to tell us how to live like good individuals and be happy in this world and the hereafter."" [366] ""The fifth article of Islamic faith is belief in life after death. The life of this world and all that is in it will come to an end on a divinely appointed date, which is called the Last Day (Qiyamat). All human beings who have lived in the world will then be restored to life and will be presented before God. This is called resurrection (Hashr). The entire record of every person will be presented before God for final judgement (Hisab). Those who excel in goodness will be rewarded. Those whose evils and wrongdoings outweigh their good deeds will be punished. Those who are condemned and deserve punishment will be sent to hell (Jahannam). Those who emerge successfully from the final judgement will go to paradise (Cannat). [...]Muslims must desist from the practice of infanticide, from adultery, from killing unjustly, from robbing orphans, from cheating in trade, from believing false reports and from showing pride: ‘Do not slay your offspring for fear of want. It is We who provide for them, and for you. Indeed their killing is a great sin. Do not approach adultery, for it is an indecent thing and an evil way. Do not take the life which Allah has rendered sacrosanct, except for a just cause.... Do not approach the property of an orphan except in the way that is best (responsible investment) until he attains majority. Keep your covenants, for one is responsible for one's covenant. Give full measure when you measure, and weigh with even scales (when you weigh). This is better, and will be the best in the end.

Garo Hills,InGaroE,1,"Garo supernatural beings could be considered high gods, in that we define these as ""a spiritual being who is believed to have created all reality and/or to be its ultimate governor"". However, they did not punish or reward mortals on the basis of morality. 'The Garo believe in supernatural beings whom they call mite. This word may be glossed both as “gods” and as “spirits”. As Robbins Burling (1963:54), who studied the Garo in India, writes, the term mite “covers both beings whom we would call gods and certain lesser, quite different nuisances, which hardly deserve to be known by any term more dignified than spirits.” To some of these mite the Garo attribute the creation of all the creatures of the world, the control of natural phenomena and the granting of health, wealth and happiness to mankind. Other mite, they say, are the cause of illness, disease and other misfortune. Consequently, Garo talk of some mite as being good and friendly, because they can help mankind, and others as being invariably malicious. But, Garo say, friendly mite are also capable of causing sickness and misfortune, if people anger them. But whether beneficent or malicious, Garo do not terminologically differentiate the two kinds of mite. Furthermore they say that all mite, good or bad, need to be propitiated.' [1,062] 'No suggestion is made that a man’s behavior in this world affects his later destiny. Spirits and gods are amoral, and punishment for wrong behavior comes in this world or not at all. One treats the spirits and gods with respect and circumspection because they can cause sickness and crop failure, but they do not send these as punishment for immoral behavior. Morality has a more pragmatic basis. Nothing is wrong unless it hurts someone else, and one may expect that the other person and his family will take action against the wrongdoer. One need not wait for punishment from the gods.'[1,063]"

Iceland,IsCommw,1,"Norse religion is relatively poorly understood, especially as much of what we know about Norse beliefs generally was recorded by Christian authors. However, perhaps we could infer that Norse gods actively intervened in human affairs (but not necessarily on a moral basis) based on sources such as the poem Hindluljod, where Odin is thus described: “He gives speech and brains to men, sailing wind to men and poetry to poets, courage to many a warrior.”[520] Also, perhaps we could infer supernatural enforcement against harm based on the fact that the Prose Edda--and specifically the Voluspa section--mentions the bodies of oath breakers among the things chewed by the dragon Nidhogg during Ragnarok, the Norse Apocalypse[521]. Christianity was introduced during the Commonwealth period. The Christian god is ""the creator of the universe, omniscient and omnipotent""[522] and he punishes moral transgression: ""[A]fter the Resurrection, when God and Jesus appear to pass judgement, one must 'render an account' (Matt. 12:36).

Kachi Plain,PkIndGr,4,"The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple.” [327] ""It is now evident that, for Hesiod, κακότης‎ represents moral badness and the opposite to virtue, arete. A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community. Just as Hesiod connects the bad man with injustice and religious danger, so he presents moral righteousness and adherence to justice (δίκη‎) as coexisting with ritual correctness. Gregory Nagy points out that in Op. 336–41, a passage which follows the lines quoted above, the moral correctness of δίκη‎ is ‘programmatically re-enforced by the ritual correctness of the just man’:26 Perses is again reminded that gods punish unjust deeds (ἄδικα ἔργα‎; vv. 325–34), and that he should often sacrifice purely and cleanly to the deathless gods and propitiate them often with libations and incense (vv. 336–41). Religious correctness is thus laid out as avoiding unjust deeds and as honouring the gods with sacrifices and libations.//""In vv. 325–34 the following deeds are listed as unjust (ἄδικα ἔργα‎): gaining wealth by force, stealing, or deception; wronging a suppliant or a guest; engaging in illicit sexual intercourse; offending orphans or aged parents. These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333–4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in agos. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus. It governs all social and religious relationships; it encompasses religious correctness. Moral goodness equals adherence to justice, whereas ‘badness’ (κακία‎ or κακότης‎) is equal to injustice and religious transgression."""

Kachi Plain,AfHepht,7,"""Summarizing, in the Hephthalite state was several religions: Buddhism, Zoroastrism, Christianity (basically Nestorianism), Manichaeism, Hinduism, as well as pagan views (the worship of the Sky, Fire). The Hephthalites held various religious views. It is difficult to say if one of religion dominated, because of the controversial nature of the sources. It seems that different religions co-existed and religious tolerance was characteristic in the Hephthalite empire, as it was later for the Turks and the Mongols in the time of Chingis khan."" [497] In Hinduism: ""Among the cosmic laws that constitute dharma, the law of karma, or action, is especially relevant to rebirth. By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them.""

[500] In Manicheism: ""However, it is stressed in Manicheism that it was the Father of Greatness himself who, of all the beings in the World of Light, stood up against the attack of the powers of Darkness (Keph. 63). He did so in the person of the First Man, who is called his own Soul and Self according to Alexander of Lycopolis (see above). He saved the World of Light at the cost of some of his own light substance. After this achievement he remained unmolested by the powers of Darkness, but that does not mean that he became a passive deus absconditus. (Cf. Psalm-Book ,ed. Allberry, 1938, p. 161, 31-32: “One is the God that is hidden, that is revealed . . silent . . He it is that speaks also,” similarly ibid., p. 171, 27-28). On the contrary, he is a deity who is often praised and invoked (see Boyce, 1960, p. 148, section 40.), and that can only mean that he constantly intervenes in the world on behalf of the Living Soul."""

(2) Punishment from the gods was expected to occur as disasters affecting the group/state, such as plague or famine or battle loss, more than the striking down of guilty individuals; (3) What we think of as the distinction between ritual transgression and ethical transgression tends to be collapsed, with ethical wrongdoing very often brought under the aegis of the gods or redefined as an offense to the gods.""[603].

Later, this image was embodied in the central figure of the Yakut pantheon, Iuriung Aiyy toion, the “White Creator God,” the god of light, the personified image of the Sun, with the functions of sovereign of the Universe. Then came the other aiyy deities. A particularly important place was occupied by Aal Uot ichchite, the spirit of sacred fire-both of the sacrificial flame and of the domestic hearth. Like the Arian Agni, Aal Uot ichchite was considered to be the protector of the family and the giver of good fortune and healthy offspring.

Those few ideas on the subject which they borrowed from the Russians together with Christianity have somehow dried up in their minds, become dim, and have been delegated to the background.

It is noteworthy that the Yakut world conception does not bear any mystical facets; they are aware of harmful, helpful, and indifferent phenomena, but no sinful phenomena. The concept of grace, as a result of the victory by the spirit over the body, mortification of the flesh, chastity, humility, and other ascetic ideals, is completely foreign to them.

Lowland Andes,EcJivaE,1,"Beierle writes that 'There are no gods who play ethical or moral roles in the Jivaro pantheon'[1,017].

'The Jívaro believe that witchcraft is the cause of the vast majority of illnesses and non-violent deaths. Practically the only diseases not attributed to witchcraft are “white man's diseases” (suηurä), normally of an epidemic nature, [Page 153] such as whooping cough, measles, colds, and some mild diarrheas. The normal waking life, as noted before, is simply “a lie,” or illusion, while the true forces that determine daily events are supernatural and can only be seen and manipulated with the aid of hallucinogenic drugs.

Particularly in the early phase of the texts, divination topics often envision Powers harming the king, despoiling the harvest and, in one case, bringing an end to the city of Shang. The Shang rulers seek advance approval for their actions - sometimes, it seems, obsessively - but there is no suggestion that the basis for approval will be anything other than the arbitrary inclinations of the Powers, influenced by the do ut des relationship maintained by the king. The king's religious legitimacy would depend, in such a case, on his care to consult and ability to read and carry out action conforming to the oracle, not on principles of morality.//""Again, this may simply be a function of the nature of the oracle texts, and the theodicy of Shang religion may have been expressed through other media unavailable to us now."""

Niger Inland Delta,MaSaadi,1,"Allah created and governs the cosmos. At the resurrection (Hashr), Allah will send individuals to hell (Jahannam) or paradise (Cannat) after final judgment (Hisab) of their behavior (e.g. cheating, theft). ""As an uncompromising and pure monotheistic religion, according to Islam, God is one and unique (tawhid); and He has no partner, no children and no parents. He is eternal and everywhere. He is Creator of the universe, which is not self-explanatory. He is merciful, compassionate and loving. He sent prophets to guide humankind, to tell us how to live like good individuals and be happy in this world and the hereafter."" [334] ""The fifth article of Islamic faith is belief in life after death. The life of this world and all that is in it will come to an end on a divinely appointed date, which is called the Last Day (Qiyamat). All human beings who have lived in the world will then be restored to life and will be presented before God. This is called resurrection (Hashr). The entire record of every person will be presented before God for final judgement (Hisab). Those who excel in goodness will be rewarded. Those whose evils and wrongdoings outweigh their good deeds will be punished. Those who are condemned and deserve punishment will be sent to hell (Jahannam). Those who emerge successfully from the final judgement will go to paradise (Cannat). [...]Muslims must desist from the practice of infanticide, from adultery, from killing unjustly, from robbing orphans, from cheating in trade, from believing false reports and from showing pride: ‘Do not slay your offspring for fear of want. It is We who provide for them, and for you. Indeed their killing is a great sin. Do not approach adultery, for it is an indecent thing and an evil way. Do not take the life which Allah has rendered sacrosanct, except for a just cause....

Niger Inland Delta,MlBaman,2,"""The Bamana religion is based on the belief in one Supreme God, Maa Ngala, 'Lord of All,' or Masa Dembali, 'Uncreated and Infinite Lord.' God is responsible for creating the world and all that is in the world. It is both immanent and transcendent. As in other African religious traditions, however, once the initial creative process was over, the Supreme Being elected to reside in the sky and delegated the governance of the world to lesser spiritual entities. It is to those entities, rather than to God, that the Bamana men and women address their requests and make offerings. These include divinities such as Nya, Nyawrole, Jarawera, Ntomo, Nama, and Komo, which act as Maa Ngala's ministers and agents."""

Sogdiana,AfKushn,3,"At different times during Kushan history, and in different combinations, Kushan emperors patronised Greek religion, Hinduism (specifically, Siva worship), Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism [737], as well as a number of less well-known Indo-Iranian cults.

Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them.

Ling et al describe sacrifices intended to secure 'pardon for sins after death'[821], but they also write that one's fate in the afterlife was determined by the circumstances of death rather than moral conduct, and that the Miao lacked the notion of hell: 'Although the Miao do not differentiate between shen and kuei, they do believe that there is a difference between good and bad kuei. The good kuei live in the yin /superna tural/ world of heaven [ta□ pia□]. The earth, on which people live, is the yang /mundane/ world. They do not have the theory of hell, but they believe that under the earth there lives a different kind of human beings. These people are as big as the little finger and live in houses plaited of mugwort and grass. A human being has soul [pien□] and a body [ko□-□ieŋ□]. [...] Those who suffer a sudden or violent death, such as from knife or spear wound, or from difficult childbirth, rolling into a gully, or falling into a pit, after death many become evil kuei. They are unable to go up to heaven; they are either immediately reborn into another state of existence and come back to life, or remain in the world to make trouble for people. If a streak of black vapor is seen at night, they consider it the manifestation of a kuei and people cry out. “[p□ ts□(ə)□]” (meaning “drive away”), to expel them.'"

Susiana,IrAchae,2,"The following quote makes it clear the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda, was both responsible for the creation of the world and for punishing transgressors. ""[T]he prophet feels also the awe due to the God who is “Creator of all” (Y. 44.7), and who, as Lord of aša, presides over a strict justice for mankind by which the wicked, who have chosen to act “at Lie’s commands” (Y. 31.1) will be in due course condemned. Their destination is the Worst Existence, i.e., Hell, which has been brought into being by Angra Mainyu (Y. 30.4). Mazdā has “appointed recompenses” (Y. 43.5), decreeing that “the end shall be different for each” (Y. 48.4); but he “has left to men’s wills (the choice between) holy and unholy” (Y. 45.9), and it is their own inner selves (daēnā-) which lead sinners to destruction (Y. 51.13)."""
Susiana,IrSeleu,3,"""The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple.” [587] ""It is now evident that, for Hesiod, κακότης‎ represents moral badness and the opposite to virtue, arete. A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community. Just as Hesiod connects the bad man with injustice and religious danger, so he presents moral righteousness and adherence to justice (δίκη‎) as coexisting with ritual correctness. Gregory Nagy points out that in Op. 336–41, a passage which follows the lines quoted above, the moral correctness of δίκη‎ is ‘programmatically re-enforced by the ritual correctness of the just man’:26 Perses is again reminded that gods punish unjust deeds (ἄδικα ἔργα‎; vv. 325–34), and that he should often sacrifice purely and cleanly to the deathless gods and propitiate them often with libations and incense (vv. 336–41). Religious correctness is thus laid out as avoiding unjust deeds and as honouring the gods with sacrifices and libations.//""In vv. 325–34 the following deeds are listed as unjust (ἄδικα ἔργα‎): gaining wealth by force, stealing, or deception; wronging a suppliant or a guest; engaging in illicit sexual intercourse; offending orphans or aged parents. These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333–4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in agos. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus. It governs all social and religious relationships; it encompasses religious correctness. Moral goodness equals adherence to justice, whereas ‘badness’ (κακία‎ or κακότης‎) is equal to injustice and religious transgression."""

Upper Egypt,ItRomPr,6,"Thomas Cressy: Coded as absent due to expert confirming that high gods were not present until Christianity[649] ""For the Romans, proper respect for the gods and proper interpersonal behavior were both integral to pietas, the key virtue. Pietas included duty to the family, the parents, one’s patron, and the state, as well as the gods. The gods were the guarantors of the welfare of the state and the continuance of the social order. Thus violating the social order by transgressing the mos maiorum (ancestral custom in any domain) was offensive to gods and liable to bring bad results on the group. [...] However, I think it is fair to say (1) that the Romans were more interested in punishing transgressions themselves than in waiting for the gods to do it.

Upper Egypt,TrRomDm,6,"Thomas Cressy: Coded as absent due to expert confirming that high gods were not present until Christianity[602] Before Constantine's conversion to Christianity: ""For the Romans, proper respect for the gods and proper interpersonal behavior were both integral to pietas, the key virtue. Pietas included duty to the family, the parents, one’s patron, and the state, as well as the gods. The gods were the guarantors of the welfare of the state and the continuance of the social order. Thus violating the social order by transgressing the mos maiorum (ancestral custom in any domain) was offensive to gods and liable to bring bad results on the group. [...] However, I think it is fair to say (1) that the Romans were more interested in punishing transgressions themselves than in waiting for the gods to do it. In their view, it was important to root out and punish wrongdoers so that they did not further contravene the mos maiorum and (by definition) anger the gods. Such punishment could avert disasters. (2) Punishment from the gods was expected to occur as disasters affecting the group/state, such as plague or famine or battle loss, more than the striking down of guilty individuals; (3) What we think of as the distinction between ritual transgression and ethical transgression tends to be collapsed, with ethical wrongdoing very often brought under the aegis of the gods or redefined as an offense to the gods.""[603]. As for Christianity: the Christian god is ""the creator of the universe, omniscient and omnipotent""[604] and he punishes moral transgression: ""[A]fter the Resurrection, when God and Jesus appear to pass judgement, one must 'render an account' (Matt. 12:36). Death ends the day during which good works are to be done, and then, 'the night cometh, when no man can work' (John 9:4). Everyone's work will be tried in fire and revealed (1 Cor, 3:12-13). The just, whom God will gather to His right, receive 'life everlasting', the merciless, however, who stand to His left, 'shall go into everlasting punishment' (Matt. 25:46). Everything is decided with death and that gives both life and death the weight of finality."""
