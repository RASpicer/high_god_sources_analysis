# Text Sources for High Gods from the Seshat Database

Code used for the analysis of text sources for the variable High Gods from the Seshat Database, published in [Slingerland et al. (2019) Historians Respond to Whitehouse et al. (2019), “Complex Societies Precede Moralizing Gods Throughout World History”](https://psyarxiv.com/2amjz).

# Analysis

All analysis was performed using [R version 3.5.3](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html). The following packages were used:
 - [plyr version 1.8.4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html)
 - [tidyverse version 1.2.1](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html)
 - [DT version 0.5](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT/index.html)

The analysis code can be found in analysis-code/seshat_high_gods_source_text_analysis.Rmd. The R Markdown file was generated using [knitr version 1.22](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html).

# Data Collection

"exportdat.csv" and "polities.csv" were obtained from https://github.com/pesavage/moralizing-gods on 20th March 2019. 

Data in "HighGodSourceRaw.csv" was obtained by manually extracting and classifying data from the Seshat database (http://seshatdatabank.info/nature/) on 25th March 2019.
